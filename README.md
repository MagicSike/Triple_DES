# Triple_DES
Project for CMPE 130 Spring 2021  <br />
**Description**: Triple DES encryption/decryption with text files. The input text file is assume to be a .txt file, and you must set the target of the output text file to your designated directory at the end of the main function in order for a text file to be generated. You can set the keys used by the algorithm at the beginning of the main function, but it must be 16 hex numbers. The output of the encryption/decryption process will be a .txt file. <br /> <br />
**<*Notes*>** <br />
(1) For decryption, the input ciphertext's character (in hex) count must be a multiple of 16 if the ciphertext was not obtained by the encryption of this alogrithm, else the program could break. <br />
(2) The program was first executed on VS 2017 followed by CodeBlocks.
