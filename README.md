Project for CMPE 130 Spring 2021  <br />
Description:Triple DES encryption/decryption with text files. The input text file is assume to be a .txt file and you must set the target of the output text file to your desingated directory at the end of the main function. The output of the encryption/decrpytion process will be a .txt file. <br />
Notes: The input ciphertext for decryption must be in ciphertext, else the program could break if the input character count is not a multiple of 16. <br />
